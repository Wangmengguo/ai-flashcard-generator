      "description": "Gemma 3n E4B-it is optimized for efficient execution on mobile and low-resource devices, such as phones, laptops, and tablets. It supports multimodal inputs—including text, visual data, and audio—enabling diverse tasks such as text generation, speech recognition, translation, and image analysis. Leveraging innovations like Per-Layer Embedding (PLE) caching and the MatFormer architecture, Gemma 3n dynamically manages memory usage and computational load by selectively activating model parameters, significantly reducing runtime resource requirements.\n\nThis model supports a wide linguistic range (trained in over 140 languages) and features a flexible 32K token context window. Gemma 3n can selectively load parameters, optimizing memory and computational efficiency based on the task or device capabilities, making it well-suited for privacy-focused, offline-capable applications and on-device AI solutions.

Sonnet is particularly good at:\n\n- Coding: Autonomously writes, edits, and runs code with reasoning and troubleshooting\n- Data science: Augments human data science expertise; navigates unstructured data while using multiple tools for insights\n- Visual processing: excelling at interpreting charts, graphs, and images, accurately transcribing text to derive insights beyond just the text alone\n- Agentic tasks: exceptional tool use, making it great at agentic tasks (i.e. complex, multi-step problem solving tasks that require engaging with other systems)\n\nFor the latest version (2024-10-23), check out [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet).\n\n#multimodal",
